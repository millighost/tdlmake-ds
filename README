tdlmake-ds
==========

wrapper for tdlmake be used with daz studio.

What it does:
  - the usage behaviuor is like tdlmake
  - looks up a gamma value to be used with the input image
  - calls tdlmake with a '-gamma' option

How to install/use it:
  in the 3delight binary directory:
  - rename your tdlmake.exe to tdlmake-org.exe (name must be exactly like this)
  - rename tdlmake-ds.exe to tdlmake.exe and put it into the same folder
    (so it replaces the old tdlmake)
  - create a configuration file named "gamma.txt" in your application data
    directory (in windows this is usually C:\users\NAME\Application Data).
  - write gamma values for images into the gamma.txt file. This file uses
    a simple two-column format. Each line contains a gamma value followed
    by a pattern that matches an image filename. Examples below.
  - simply use tdlmake normally (this calls the wrapper, which in turn calls
    the original tdlmake after looking into the gamma.txt)
