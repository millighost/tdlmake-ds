tdlmake-ds
==========

wrapper for tdlmake be used with daz studio.

What it does:
  - the usage behaviour is like tdlmake
  - looks up a gamma value to be used with the input image
  - calls tdlmake with an appropriate '-gamma' option

How to install/use it:
  in the 3delight binary directory:
  - rename your tdlmake.exe to tdlmake-org.exe (name must be exactly like this)
  - rename tdlmake-ds.exe to tdlmake.exe and put it into the same folder
    (so it replaces the old tdlmake)
  - create a configuration file named "gamma.txt" in your application data
    directory (in windows this is usually C:\users\NAME\Application Data,
    with NAME being your username).
  - write gamma values for images into the gamma.txt file. This file uses
    a simple two-column format. Each line contains a gamma value followed
    by a pattern that matches an image filename. Examples below.
  - simply use tdlmake normally (this calls the wrapper, which in turn calls
    the original tdlmake after looking into the gamma.txt)

Configuration file syntax:

In the users application data directory the configuration file 'gamma.txt' is
used. It is a simple line-oriented format. Each line contains the definition
of a gamma value for one or more image files or a comment.

Any line not conforming to this format is currently silently ignored
by the wrapper. To avoid future conflicts, use lines starting with two dashes
as a comment-line:

  -- this is a comment line.

Lines that are not comment lines contain a gamma value and a filename of a
texture, separated by whitespace:

  <gamma-value>  <texture-filename>

<gamma-value> is a value to be used for the gamma. Typical values are
  1.0 and 2.2.

<texture-filename> contains the filename of an image texture. Use the
  filename of the original texture here. I.e. use name the JPG or TIF here,
  not the name of the TDL-file.

* A simple example:

    1.0 TrousersTransmap.jpg

  this would lead to the texture TrousersTransmap.jpg to being converted with
  a gamma value of 1. Note that the directory name does not matter in this
  case, i.e. both of the texture files

    C:\mytextures\TrousersTransmap.jpg and
    C:\downloaded\cgtextures\TrousersTransmap.jpg

  would be used with a gamma value of 1.

* It is possible to use an
  asterisk (*) to assign a gamma value to a set of texture filenames
  matching the pattern. Example:

    1.0 *Bump.jpg

  would use the gamma value 1.0 on every texture which name ends with 'bump.jpg'.
  The matching is always without attention to the upper-/lowercase, the
  following two texture names would get a gamma of 1.0:

    C:\mytextures\TrousersBump.jpg
    C:\mytextures\jumper_bump.jpg

  but also this one:

    C:\mytextures\albumA-Z\AlbumP.jpg

  which might not be what is wanted, so a bit of caution has to be applied
  when using patterns.
  
* Image patterns might contain directory names in addition to the image name:

    2.2 mytextures/color.jpg

  Those paths are matched against the trailing part of the actual texture
  filename, so this would apply to

    C:\mytextures\color.jpg and
    C:\data\mytextures\color.jpg

  but not to:

    C:\mytextures\clothing\color.jpg

  because there is a 'clothing' between the 'mytextures' and the 'color'.
  Note in the pattern 'mytextures/color.jpg' i used a forward slash '/',
  where in windows usually a backward slash '\' is used. Those two slashes
  are equivalent in patterns, so 'mytextures/color.jpg' and
  'mytextures\color.jpg' represent exactly the same filenames.

* To ignore intermediate directories in patterns, a double slash can be used
  as a wildcard:

    2.2 mytextures//color.jpg

  This would work with both the previous example filenames.

    C:\mytextures\clothing\color.jpg and
    C:\mytextures\color.jpg

  so the double-slash '//' matches any sequence of directory names (even the
  empty sequence of names). If i wanted to match only the
  'C:\mytextures\clothing\color.jpg' but not 'C:\mytextures\color.jpg' the
  double-slash would not work, but i can use an asterisk to do that:

    2.2 mytextures/*/color.jpg

  matches

    C:\mytextures\clothing\color.jpg

  but not

    C:\mytextures\color.jpg
