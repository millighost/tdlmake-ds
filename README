tdlmake-ds
==========

wrapper for tdlmake be used with daz studio.

What it does:
  - the usage behaviour is like tdlmake
  - looks up a gamma value to be used with the input image
  - calls tdlmake with an appropriate '-gamma' option

How to install/use it:
  in the 3delight binary directory:
  - rename your tdlmake.exe to tdlmake-org.exe (name must be exactly like this)
  - rename tdlmake-ds.exe to tdlmake.exe and put it into the same folder
    (so it replaces the old tdlmake)
  - create a configuration file named "gamma.txt" in your application data
    directory (in windows this is usually C:\users\NAME\Application Data,
    with NAME being your username).
  - write gamma values for images into the gamma.txt file. This file uses
    a simple two-column format. Each line contains a gamma value followed
    by a pattern that matches an image filename. Examples below.
  - simply use tdlmake normally (this calls the wrapper, which in turn calls
    the original tdlmake after looking into the gamma.txt)

Configuration file syntax:

In the users application data directory the configuration file 'gamma.txt' is
used. It is a simple line-oriented format. Each line contains the definition
of a gamma value for one or more image files. A line looks like this:

  <gamma-value>  <texture-filename>

<gamma-value> is a value to be used for the gamma. Typical values are
  1.0 and 2.2.

<texture-filename> contains the filename of an image texture. Use the
  filename of the original texture here. I.e. use name the JPG or TIF here,
  not the name of the TDL-file.
  

Any line not conforming to this format is currently silently ignored
by the wrapper. To avoid future conflicts, use lines starting with two dashes
as a comment-line:

  -- this is a comment line.
